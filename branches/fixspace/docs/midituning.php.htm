          <p>The MIDI Tuning specification allows the sharing of "microtunings" (user-defined scales other than 12-tone equal temperament) among instruments, and the switching of these tunings during real-time performance. </p>
          <p>The MIDI Tuning messages include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bulk Tuning Dump Request (non-real-time) </li>
            <li>Bulk Tuning Dump (non-real-time) </li>
            <li>Single-note Tuning Change (real-time) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even though the first two messages are in the Universal Non-Real Time area and the last in the Real Time area, they keep the same sub-IDs to more obviously group them and possibly ease the parsing of them. Single Note Retuning allows retuning of individual MIDI note numbers to new frequencies in real time as a performance control. </p>
          <p>The specification does not attempt to dictate how any manufacturer implements microtuning, but provides a general means of sharing tuning data among different instruments. This goal requires some shared assumptions which have some architectural implications. The standard requires that any of the 128 defined MIDI key numbers (or at least those MIDI key numbers covered by the instrument's playable range) be tunable to any frequency within the proposed frequency range. The standard also strongly suggests, but does not enforce, an exponential (constant cents) rather than linear (constant Hertz) tuning resolution across the instrument's frequency range. </p>
          <p>The specification permits the changing of tunings in real-time, both by the selection of presets and on a per-note basis. When a sounding note is affected by either real-time tuning message, the note should instantly be re-tuned to the new frequency while it continues to sound; this change should occur without glitching, forced Note-Offs, re-triggering or other audible artifacts (see section 4, "Additional"). </p>
          <p>The specification provides for 128 tuning memory locations (programs). As with the MIDI program change message, this is a maximum value. An instrument supporting MIDI Tuning may have any lesser number of tuning programs. The specification requires only that all existing tuning programs respond to the messages as specified (See section 3, "Continuous Controller Messages"). </p>
          <p>Although directly applicable to some existing instruments, the specification attempts to define a coherent framework within which the designers of future instruments can profitably work. It is hoped that by providing this framework the specification will make microtunability more easily implemented and more common on MIDI instruments. </p>
          <span style="text-transform: capitalize" class="biggerbolder">Frequency
          Data format</span>          <p>The frequency resolution of MIDI Tuning should be stringent enough to satisfy most demands of music and experimentation. The specification provides resolution somewhat finer than one-hundredth of a cent. Instruments may support MIDI tuning without necessarily providing this resolution in their hardware; the specification simply permits the transfer of tuning data at any resolution up to this limit. </p>
          <p>Frequency data shall be sent via system exclusive messages. Because system exclusive data bytes have their high bit set low, containing 7 bits of data, a 3-byte (21-bit) frequency data word is used for specifying a frequency with the suggested resolution. An instrument which does not support the full suggested resolution may discard any unneeded lower bits on reception, but it is preferred where possible that full resolution be stored internally, for possible transmission to other instruments which can use the increased resolution. </p>
          <p>Frequency data shall be defined in units which are fractions of a semitone. The frequency range starts at MIDI note 0, C = 8.1758 Hz, and extends above MIDI note 127, G = 12543.875 Hz. The first byte of the frequency data word specifies the nearest equal-tempered semitone below the frequency. The next two bytes (14 bits) specify the fraction of 100 cents above the semitone at which the frequency lies. Effective resolution = 100 cents / 214 = .0061 cents. </p>
          <p>One of these values ( 7F 7F 7F ) is reserved to indicate not frequency data but a "no change" condition. When an instrument receives these bytes as frequency data, it should make no change to its stored frequency data for that MIDI key number. This is to prevent instruments which do not use the full range of 128 MIDI key numbers from sending erroneous tuning data to instrument which do use the full range. The three-byte frequency representation may be interpreted as follows: </p>

          <p>If an instrument does not support the full range of 128 MIDI key numbers, it should ignore data associated with un-playable notes on reception. </p>
          <p>This message can be used to make changes in inactive (background) tunings as well. This message may also, at the discretion of the manufacturer, be transmitted by the instrument under particular circumstances (for example, while holding down one or more keys and pressing a "send-single-note-tuning" front panel button). </p>
          <p>class="mainnbold">Changing Tuning Programs</p>
          <p>Registered parameter numbers 03 and 04 are used to select any of the instrument's stored tunings as the "current" or active tuning. Instruments which permit the storage of multiple microtunings should respond to these messages by instantly changing the "current" tuning to the specified stored tuning. This change takes effect immediately and must occur without audible artifacts (notes-off, resets, re-triggers, glitches, etc.) if any affected notes are sounding when the message is received. </p>
          <p>As with the MIDI program change message, no assumptions are made as to the underlying architecture of the instrument. For instance, in cases where layered or multi-timbral sounds might be assigned to different tunings, so that more than one tuning might be active, the manufacturer may decide how best to interpret these messages. The basic channel number might prove useful in discriminating between multiple active tunings, or a certain range of tuning programs might be set aside and defined as active. </p>
          <p>The Tuning Program Select message is sent as a Registered Parameter number 03 controller message, followed by either a data entry, data increment, or data decrement controller message, e.g. (with running status shown): </p>
          <p>Bn 64 03 65 00 06 tt (data entry) <br>
  Bn 64 03 65 00 60 7F (data increment) <br>
  Bn 64 03 65 00 61 7F (data decrement) </p>
          <p>n = basic channel number <br>
  tt = Tuning Program number (1-128) </p>
          <p>Likewise, the Tuning Bank Select Registered Parameter number 04 is sent as follows: </p>
          <p>Bn 64 04 65 00 06 tt (data entry) <br>
  Bn 64 04 65 00 60 7F (data increment) <br>
  Bn 64 04 65 00 61 7F (data decrement) </p>
          <p>n = basic channel number <br>
  tt = Tuning Bank number (1-128) </p>
          <p>For maximum flexibility, this Bank Number is kept separate from the normal Program Change Bank Select (controller #00). However, an instrument may wish to link the two as a feature for the user, especially if a tuning bank is stored alongside a patch parameter bank (for example, on a RAM cartridge). </p>
          <p>If an instrument receives a Tuning Program or Bank number for which it has no Program or Bank, it should ignore that message. Standard mappings of "common" tunings to program numbers are not being proposed at this time. </p>
          <p class="mainbold">Comments:</p>
          <p>There is some question as to whether instantaneous response to real-time tuning changes is desirable in every circumstance. In some performance situations it makes more sense if a tuning change affect only those notes which occur subsequent to the change, and not affect sounding notes. But there are also situations in which tuning changes should take place instantaneously, as specified in the standard, and should affect sounding notes without disrupting their continuity. </p>
          <p>If the instrument responds well in the latter situation, some work-around is possible for the former. The reverse is not true. Therefore the standard requires that tuning changes immediately affect sounding notes. Manufacturers might, however, consider implementing a switchable "instantaneous/next-note-on" option within an instrument. </p>
          <p>Single Note Retuning is intended for performance. Because of there are two primary concerns: 1) the RAM required for temporary copies of tuning tables; and 2) the computational load of smoothly updating the pitch of affected active notes. It is clear that in order to recognize the Single Note Retune message, a copy of the current Tuning Program needs to be kept in RAM. In a multi-timbral environment there is potentially a copy for each virtual instrument. A high-end instrument could afford the upwards of 8K of RAM needed for per-virtual-instrument copies. More modest instruments may choose to only implement one alterable RAM table and either make it available only to the basic channel virtual instrument or require that all instruments share the same tuning. Provided that it is explained in the user's manual, any of these methods is acceptable.

          (CA-020)</p>
          <p>The first three messages in these extensions are based on existing MIDI Tuning messages, with the addition of the bank select byte. In the MIDI Spec V4.2, document version 96.1, page 50, a Tuning Bank Select Registered Parameter Number (RPN) is defined for choosing among banks of tuning programs. However, no way to store a tuning message in a specific bank is defined, because the messages do not include a bank number in addition to the tuning program number. These extensions correct that oversight. </p>
          <p>The fourth new message provides a <strong>non real-time </strong> version of the Single Note Tuning message. The intent of a non-real time message is that it should specifically be sent as a setup message. If it is NOT sent as a setup message (that is, if it is sent during performance), it is assumed that the message will be ignored for notes that are already sounding. However, certain Recommended Practices, (RPs), may implement this differently. Manufacturers should therefore consult the specific RP for the required response and should document the device's response in the user manual. </p>
          <p>The last two new messages support Scale/Octave tables (see <a href="#oct_ext">Scale/Octave Tuning
          </a>). </p>

Each message that is received will offset from the original preset, not from the modified tuning. </p>
          <p>Scale/Octave Tuning consists of the following four messages (<em>plus the two new Scale/Octave Tuning Dump messages described in <a href="#bank_ext">MIDI Tuning Bank/Dump Extensions</a>, above</em>). The first and second messages will offset the tuning of each note in cents. The range is -64/+63 cents. The first message is a real time version. Notes that are already sounding should be updated after receiving this message, and future notes will be tuned to the new offsets. The second message is non-real time. The third and fourth messages will offset the tuning of each note using a 2 byte encoding, which allows greater range and resolution. With two tuning bytes, the tuning range can be expanded to approximately +/-100 cents with a resolution of .012207 cents (200 cents divided by 16,384 = .012207 cents). The third message is a real time message. Notes that are already sounding should be updated after receiving this message, and future notes will be tuned to the new offsets. The fourth message is non real-time. </p>
          <p>A message can update multiple MIDI channels simultaneously. This is achieved by using a 3 byte channel field in the SysEx message, with 1 bit representing each MIDI channel. There are 5 additional bits in one of the channel bytes, which must be set to 0. These bits are reserved for future expansion of the tuning messages. They are NOT to be used in any proprietary fashion. </p>

          <p class="mainbold">Notes: </p>
          <p>Using a channel bitmap scheme in a system exclusive message is unconventional, but this ability is really necessary for the computer based tuning schemes, in order to change intonation identically on several channels quickly. (Ed: This text was amended 12/2000 by RP-025/amd1) </p>
          <p> The intent of a non-real time message is that it should specifically be sent as a setup message. If it is NOT sent as a setup message (that is, if it is sent during performance), it is assumed that the message will be ignored for notes that are already sounding. However, certain Recommended Practices, (RPs), may implement this differently. Manufacturers should therefore consult the specific RP for the required response and should document the device's response in the user manual. </p>

If presets are supported, it is suggested that the first preset, selected by Bank 0H and Preset 0H, would be equal temperament.
