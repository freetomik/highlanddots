In order to prepare for DR1, the following things need to be
completed or resolved.
  * The 'decoupling' branch complete with the new UI
  * Resolve [Issue 16](https://code.google.com/p/highlanddots/issues/detail?id=16), [Issue 21](https://code.google.com/p/highlanddots/issues/detail?id=21), [Issue 27](https://code.google.com/p/highlanddots/issues/detail?id=27), [Issue 31](https://code.google.com/p/highlanddots/issues/detail?id=31), [Issue 32](https://code.google.com/p/highlanddots/issues/detail?id=32)
  * Make the 'proportional spacing' engine the default.

In addition, the following issues should be examined and closed if they indeed resolved.
